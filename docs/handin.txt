        ** Caleb made 0 contributions to the project. He remained silent during planning stages, offered no feedback
        on the wireframes or project requirements, and made 0 commits on the actual project. Our attempts
        to include him at every phase were usually met with silent acknowledgement, but no actions. In general, he never
        spoke to us unless we asked him a question. We made sure that he was aware of our plans and time tables, yet
        he made no effort to communicate with us. The largest contribution he made to the project was his section during
        our project demo.
